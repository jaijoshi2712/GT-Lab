# MC405 Lab Project
## Utilising Graph algorithms to solve the word ladder and knight's tour problems.
In this project, we will be leveraging some of the algorithms and code that we have learnt through the year in this lab and applying them to solve two problems, namely the <b>‘word ladder’</b> and the <b>‘knight’s tour’</b> problems. <br>
First, lets introduce both the aforementioned problems:
### Word Ladder
Word ladder (also known as Doublets,word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams,or word golf) is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll. A word ladder puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to link the two, in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter.<br>
<b>Rules</b><br>
The player is given a start word and an end word. In order to win the game, the player must change the start word into the end word progressively, creating an existing word at each step. Each step consists of a single letter substitution. <br>
As each step changes only one letter, the number of steps must be at least the Hamming distance between the two words, i.e the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different – four in the above example. <br>
### Knight’s Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open. <br>
The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chess boards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards. <br>
